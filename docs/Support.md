!!! info "Information"

    The developers may take some time to respond to your issues and help request, so please be patient.
    Leaving a bad review with the issue you're having, or sending the issue via Discord and leaving the
    server, won't fix the problem.

!!! warning "Unsupported Versions Notice"

    Please keep the plugin updated with the recent releases. Using obsolete versions and then requesting
    for help or reporting an issue will be automatically ignored and rejected.
