If you have any questions, submit a feature, or report an issue, visit the official [Discord server](https://discord.gg/uh7gqDY6sz), or submit a new issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TFAGaming/Homestead/issues).

!!! info

    The developers may take some time to respond to your issues and help request, so please be patient.
    Leaving a bad review with the issue you're having, or sending the issue via Discord and leaving the
    server, won't fix the problem.
