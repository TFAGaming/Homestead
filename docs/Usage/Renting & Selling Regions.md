# Renting & Selling Regions

Place an **Oak, Dark Oak, Birch, Jungle, Spruce, Acacia, or Bamboo** sign on a block inside a region that you own, and write this on the sign:

### For Renting

* \[Rent]
* (The region name that you are renting)
* (The price for renting the region, for example, **12000** ($12k)...)
* (The duration of the rent, for example, **1d** (1 day), **15m** (15 minutes)...)&#x20;

To cancel a lease, use `/region rent cancel`.

!!! warning

    The lessor (who leases the region) has all permissions in your region; they can do anything. You cannot control or manage the flags for leasers, but you can still kick them via menus.

### For Selling

* \[Sell]
* (The region name that you are selling)
* (The price for selling the region, for example, **14500** ($14.5k)...)
* (Keep it empty)

!!! info "Information"

    Every payment is saved in the region's bank.

You cannot cancel the purchase after you sell your region to a player; it's a permanent action that is irreversible (unless the purchaser sells the region back to you).
