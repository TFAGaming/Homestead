# Welcome Signs

If the server you're playing is welcome signs-based, you must place a sign to allow players to visit your region!

To advertise to the players to visit the region, tell them to use this command: `/region visit [your playername]`

* \[Welcome]
* (The region name that you placed the sign in)
* (Keep it empty)
* (Keep it empty)

!!! info "Information"

    The only disadvantage of welcome signs is that trusted players cannot visit the regions where they are trusted unless the region's owner sets a welcome sign for everybody to visit.
