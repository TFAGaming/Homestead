# Editing a Region

Any command that manages a region (like `/claim`, `/unclaim`, `/region rename`...) will be applied to the player's targeted region.

To set a region as a targeted region, use `/region set target [region]`.

!!! info "Information"

    The regions a player can set as targeted regions are the regions the player owns and the regions they're trusted in.

    If the player is an operator, they can set any region as the targeted region.
