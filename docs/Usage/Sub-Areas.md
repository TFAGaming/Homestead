Sub-Areas are specific areas inside a region that have specific flags for global players.

To create a sub-area, you must select two points. To get the selection tool, craft a **Golden Hoe**.

!!! bug "Unresolved Glitch"

    There is a bug that when you instantly get the selection tool on your selected item slot, the title won't appear. To avoid this, change your slot and hold the selection tool back.

    This glitch won't affect the server's performance or the plugin's functionality.

After getting the selection tool, hold the item, left-click on the first point, and right-click on the second point.

After selecting two points, use `/region subareas create [name]`.

To set a sub-areas flags, use `/region subareas flags [subarea] [flag] <allow/deny>`.
