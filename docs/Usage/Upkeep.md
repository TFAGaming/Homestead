# Upkeep

Region owners must pay an amount of money to keep up their chunks, or else some or all of them will be unclaimed. By default, region owners must pay every week.

The amount to pay is calculated from this formula:\
**number of region chunks Ã— chunks price multiplier = the amount to pay**

For example, if your region has **16 chunks,** and the chunks multiplier is **$2k**, you must pay **$32k**.

!!! warning

    If you fail to pay the upkeep, any chunk that is unable to be paid will be unclaimed.

    For example, a region has 10 claimed chunks, but it can pay the upkeep only for 6, so the 4 last claimed chunks will be unclaimed.
