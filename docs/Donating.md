# Donating

If you would like to support Homestead by donating money, use crypto.

I ("I" refers to the developer, "T.F.A") only accept cryptos because I'm currently living in a region where PayPal and Stripe are not supported, but I have a Credit Card on [ByBit](https://www.bybit.com/). So, if you would like to donate, here are the QR codes:
