# This is the configuration file for the Homestead plugin.
# Made a mistake in this file? Delete the file, and restart the server. The plugin will generate a new one for you.
# Posting spam in my repository's issues section or in the Spigot review section with "It doesn't work" won't fix the plugin.
# If you have a genuine bug report or a suggestion, please create a new "issue" on GitHub. Thank you!

# How would you like to store regions data?
# Available database providers:
# - PostgreSQL: postgresql (Recommended for advanced servers)
# - MySQL: mysql (Recommended for advanced servers)
# - SQLite: sqlite (Recommended for small servers)
# - YAML: yaml
# WARNING 1: If you selected PostgreSQL or MySQL, please create a new database (postgre) or a new schema (mysql) with the name: "homestead_data"
# WARNING 2: PostgreSQL JDBC Driver is bundled within the plugin's dependencies! There is no need to download the driver and load it in the server's libraries.
database:
  provider: "sqlite"

  # PostgreSQL configuration:
  postgresql:
    username: "USERNAME"
    password: "PASSWORD"
    host: "localhost"
    port: 3306

  # MySQL configuration:
  mysql:
    username: "USERNAME"
    password: "PASSWORD"
    host: "localhost"
    port: 3306

  # SQLite configuration:
  # NOTE: The data file will be saved in the server's main directory.
  sqlite: "homestead_data.db"

# The interval for cache to save regions data to the database (in seconds).
# If you are using SQLite and your server has many active players, we recommend you to higher the interval to 300 seconds (5 minutes).
cache-interval: 30 # 30 seconds (Good for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and YAML)
